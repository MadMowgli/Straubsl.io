> The purpose of the current study is to determine the chances, challenges and limitations of the vector space model applied to parts of the CommonCrawl dataset. The whole dataset cannot be considered due to computational limitations, however the conceptual approach will be applicable to any data structured in the Web ARChive format. Highlighting the limitations of the approach taken in this paper and providing an outlook on how to advance further will be a primary feature of this work, thus creating a chance for ex-panding existing knowledge.
